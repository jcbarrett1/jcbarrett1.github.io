title: About Me
---

Hello! I'm Jacob, a recent Computer Science graduate from Stony Brook University. I've become very interested in optimization and lower level programming 
from watching many videos and talks about game development, programming generally, and computer engineering. I've spent countless hours playing Zachtronics' 
programming games, toiling over the same puzzle for hours looking to squeeze out just a bit more performance. Playing those games, and spending lots of time 
making games in my own free time has given me a well rounded skillset in programming beyond just what I was taught in school. 

Though I also learned many 
interesting things and important skills during my Computer Science education. The most valuable thing about it was just how many mysteries I've had in 
my head since I started programming were cleared up when I learned about Compilers, Assembly, CPU Design, Operating Systems, Memory Management, and many
other topics.

My interests aren't just limited to programming however. I also spend a lot of my time working on music production and composition in Ableton, playing 
piano, drawing, and playing video games. I hope to continue to expand my knowledge and skills in the many fields I find interesing.
